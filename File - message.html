<h1>Thank You, Respected Teacher 🤍</h1>

<p>
Respected Teacher,<br>
Your wisdom has been a guiding light for us all,<br>
and your encouragement has made our seniors’ journey memorable.<br><br>
As they step forward into a new chapter of life,<br>
we, the students of Class 11th, bow in gratitude.<br>
Your presence at this farewell would make it truly special,<br>
as a mentor, guide, and inspiration to us all.
